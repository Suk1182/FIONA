# FIONA
FIONA is a project aimed at creating an artificial replica of the human brain to achieve AGI by integrating human cognitive and hormonal intelligence into machines. It adapts to users' voices, faces, and emotions, mimicking them. FIONA can also serve as a teacher or educator, ensuring continuous engagement and reducing the feeling of absence.

Project FIONA, aims to create an AI Language model that 
understands and responds to human emotions in natural 
language and facial expressions. It's designed to build a deep 
emotional connection with users by recognizing emotions like 
joy, sadness, anger, and more. FIONA uses advanced language 
models like GPT-3 and BERT to analyze emotions and sentiment 
in text.
 To achieve this, FIONA combines pre-trained models with fine
tuning or custom models built with PyTorch or TensorFlow. Unlike 
other systems, FIONA not only reacts to emotions but also tracks 
and learns from user interactions to tailor responses over time.
 It includes face and speech recognition for personalized 
interaction and authentication. FIONA's key feature is its ability 
to evolve as a friend, learning from user experiences to better 
understand and respond to their emotions. This project fills a 
crucial gap by focusing on emotional tracking, making it a 
valuable companion for users.
