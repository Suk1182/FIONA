# FIONA
FIONA is a project aimed at creating an artificial replica of the human brain to achieve AGI by integrating human cognitive and hormonal intelligence into machines. It adapts to users' voices, faces, and emotions, mimicking them. FIONA can also serve as a teacher or educator, ensuring continuous engagement and reducing the feeling of absence.
